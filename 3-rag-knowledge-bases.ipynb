    "# 3 - Creating Multimodal RAG using Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases leverage Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), a technique that harnesses customer data stores to enhance responses generated by foundation models. Knowledge bases allow agents to access existing customer data repositories without extensive administrator overhead. To connect a knowledge base to your data, you specify an S3 bucket as the data source. By employing knowledge bases, applications gain enriched contextual information, streamlining development through a fully-managed RAG solution. This level of abstraction accelerates time-to-market by minimizing the effort of incorporating your data into agent functionality and it optimizes cost by negating the necessity for continuous model retraining to leverage private data.\n",
    "Knowledge Base Preparation\n",

    "## Use Case Description\n",
    "\n",
    "We will imagine that we are a Hotel Booking Assistant who helps user with some relevent information about the hotel such as finding where the Casino is, to what has been the performance of the hotel in certain quarter based on financial reports to basic room and hotel fare info.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this, we would need a RAG System that has these relevent information about a particular hotel. For this exercise, we will assume we are ABC Hotel and we will load some documents which have some information about the hotel. This information will include not just text but also other charts, graph information.\n",
