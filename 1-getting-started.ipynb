    "# 1 - Getting Started with Amazon Nova Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon Nova is a new generation of multimodal understanding and creative content generation models that offer state-of-the-art quality, unparalleled customization, and the best price-performance. Amazon Nova models incorporate the same secure-by-design approach as all AWS services, with built-in controls for the safe and responsible use of AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon Nova has two categories of models: \n",
    " - **Understanding models** —These models are capable of reasoning over several input modalities, including text, video, and image, and output text. \n",
    "- **Creative Content Generation models** —These models generate images or videos based on a text or image prompt.\n",
    "  \n",

    "\n",
    "**Multimodal Understanding Models**\n",
    "- **Amazon Nova Micro**: Lightening fast, cost-effective text-only model\n",
    "- **Amazon Nova Lite**: Fastest, most affordable multimodal FM in the industry for its intelligence tier\n",
    "- **Amazon Nova Pro**: The fastest, most cost-effective, state-of-the-art multimodal model in the industry\n",
    "\n",
    "**Creative Content Generation Models**\n",
    "- **Amazon Nova Canvas**: State-of-the-art image generation model\n",

    "The following workshop will be focused primarily on Amazon Nova Understanding Models. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Amazon Nova multimodal understanding** foundation models (FMs) are a family of models that are capable of reasoning over several input modalities, including text, video, documents and/or images, and output text. You can access these models through the Bedrock Converse API and InvokeModel API.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to use Amazon Nova Micro model\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon Nova Micro (Text Input Only) is the fastest and most affordable option, optimized for large-scale, latency-sensitive deployments like conversational interfaces, chats, and high-volume tasks, such as classification, routing, entity extraction, and document summarization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to use Amazon Nova Lite model\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon Nova Lite balances intelligence, latency, and cost-effectiveness. It’s optimized for complex scenarios where low latency (minimal delay) is crucial, such as interactive agents that need to orchestrate multiple tool calls simultaneously. Amazon Nova Lite supports image, video, and text inputs and outputs text. \n",
    "\n",
    "### When to use Amazon Nova Pro model\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon Nova Pro is designed for highly complex use cases requiring advanced reasoning, creativity, and code generation. Amazon Nova pro supports image, video, and text inputs and outputs text. \n"

    "## 5 Tool Use\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon Nova allows tool use in Invoke and Converse APIs, in both cases Nova standardize behind Converse’s JSON schemas so there’s a consistent experience across APIs. Tool use involves three steps: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Tool Definition**: You define the tools that the model can use by providing a JSON schema that describes each tool's functionality and input requirements. When a user sends a message, the model analyzes it to determine if a tool is necessary to generate a response. If the model identifies a suitable tool, it will return a request indicating which tool to invoke and the required input parameters.\n",
    "2. **Manual Tool** Invocation: You, as the developer, are responsible for implementing the tool based on the model's request. This means you need to execute or write the code that executes the tool's functionality and processes the input parameters provided by the model.\n",
    "3. **Sending Results Back**: After executing the tool, you must send the results back to the model in a structured format. This allows the model to incorporate the tool's output into its final response to the user. If there are any errors during the tool's execution, you can communicate this back to the model, which can adjust its response accordingly.\n",
